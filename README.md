# Substreams sink files

The `substreams-sink-files` tool provides the ability to pipe data extracted from a blockchain to various types of files-based persistence solutions.

For example, you could extract all of the ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 transfers from the Ethereum blockchain and persist the data to a files-based store.
